These simulations were created by Alex Holcombe and have been used since 2006 by him at the University of Sydney.  In 2020, Simbrain 3.04 was used. The installation instructions are here: https://java.whatanimalssee.com

# Doing the tutorial

Once you have Simbrain open, go to File menu->Open Workspace File -> and navigate to:simulations:workspaces:courseMaterials:  within that folder you will see:
1. autoAssociatorPart1.zip
2. autoAssociatorPart2.zip 
3. chasing_part1.zip
4. chasing_part2.zip

Each of 1-4 above is a lesson. Follow the instructions in the DocViewerwindow that will pop up for each.

## Hints

* Make the Network window bigger so it is easier to click on neurons and synapses.
* Arrange the DocViewer and other windows so you can easily see the contents of all three.
* Move Blonde and Brunette to opposite corners of the screen. If they get lost off-screen, resize the window.
