# Simbrain 3
Simbrain 3 code, documentation, and simulations.

While development has mostly shifted to Simbrain 4, Simbrain 3 is still what is used in classrooms and is thus still 
maintained and updated until Simbrain 4 is released and stable.

Build using `ant build`. Build the application for a given system, on that system, using `./etc/make_app.sh`

License, readme, release notes, etc. are in the aptly-named ./etc directory.
